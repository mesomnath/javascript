# Introduction to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It enables developers to implement complex features like interactive forms, animations, dynamic content updates, and responsive user interfaces.

## How JavaScript Got Started

JavaScript was created by **Brendan Eich** in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications. It was developed in just 10 days and originally named "Mocha," then "LiveScript," before being renamed to "JavaScript."

Key milestones:
- **1995**: Initial release with Netscape Navigator 2.0
- **1997**: Standardized as ECMAScript (ECMA-262)
- **2009**: Node.js introduced, enabling server-side JavaScript
- **2015**: ECMAScript 6 (ES6) brought major language improvements

## Programming Language vs Scripting Language

JavaScript is technically both:

### As a Scripting Language:
- Originally designed to script web pages
- Interpreted (not compiled ahead of time)
- Embedded within HTML documents
- Executes line-by-line at runtime

### As a Programming Language:
- Supports object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Includes functional programming features
- Used for complex application development
- Powers full-stack development (frontend and backend)

**Modern perspective**: JavaScript is considered a full-fledged programming language capable of building complete applications, though it retains its scripting language characteristics.
